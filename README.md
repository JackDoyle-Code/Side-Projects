Contains an assortment of projects that I have worked on outside of college and work

## 1. Employment Scheduling Program
### Overview
This project is a custom implementation of an employee scheduling solution, inspired by Google's OR-Tools library for combinatorial optimisation. The program is designed to efficiently assign shifts to employees while satisfying various constraints such as availability, maximum working shifts, and more. The project aims to automate scheduling tasks that would otherwise require significant manual effort.

For more information on OR-Tools and its employment scheduling capabilities, you can refer to Google's OR-Tools documentation (https://developers.google.com/optimization/scheduling/employee_scheduling)

### Files Included
Word Document (Employment Scheduling Program Tasks.docx):
This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the tasks involved in the project.

### CSV File (employee_data.csv):
The dataset used for testing the program is stored in this CSV file. It includes the number of nurses and their associated work teams. You can modify this file to experiment with different use cases.

### Jupyter Notebook (Employment_Scheduling_Program.ipynb):
This Jupyter notebook contains the Python code used to develop the employment scheduling solution. It leverages Google's OR-Tools to optimise employee schedules based on input data. The notebook includes detailed explanations of the logic behind the algorithm, and demonstrates how the constraints are modeled and solved. You can run and modify the code in an interactive environment.
